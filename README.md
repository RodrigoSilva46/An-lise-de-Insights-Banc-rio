Insights:

Disparity in educational and income distribution: The analysis reveals a trend where lower levels of education are generally associated with lower incomes. However, there are exceptions, such as the presence of individuals with lower levels of education among higher income groups.
High number of people with secondary or special secondary education: Most people have a secondary or special secondary education level, indicating an opportunity to provide financial services tailored to this large segment of the population.
Income concentration in certain income groups and housing types: The data shows that certain income groups, such as commercial associates and workers, have a stronger presence in certain types of housing, such as rented apartments and office apartments. This may suggest marketing strategies targeted at these specific groups to promote housing-related products and services.
Action Plans:

Development of affordable financial products: Based on the educational and income distribution, the bank can develop specific financial products to meet the needs of customers at different education levels and income brackets. This may include simplified bank accounts, affordable credit, and accessible investment services.
Personalized marketing segmentation: Utilizing data on income, education, and housing type, the bank can segment its customer base and target specific marketing campaigns to each group. This can increase the effectiveness of campaigns and improve customer engagement.
Partnerships with financial education programs: The bank can establish partnerships with financial education programs to offer educational resources and workshops for customers at all education levels. This can help improve financial literacy and empower customers to make more informed financial decisions.
Conclusion:

The analysis of the data has revealed valuable insights that can guide the bank in identifying improvement opportunities, targeting potentially profitable customer segments, and developing effective marketing and engagement strategies. By offering affordable financial products, segmenting marketing campaigns, and promoting financial education, the bank can better serve the needs of its customers and drive long-term growth and profitability.
